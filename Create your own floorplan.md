# Creating your own floorplan from scratch #

This is a short guide to creating your own floorplan.

Recommended resources:
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) for editing your floorplan
- [the Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/) for neat looking custom icons

## 1. Get started
Download, install and open [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/).

## 1.1 Set the size of the work area
I've set the size of my floorplan-file to match the resolution of a full-screen iPad Air (1024x768).
- Click File > Document Properties
- Ensure the top right corner says "px" as display units. There is another one under "Custom size" that should also read "px".
- Set the width and height of Orientation/custom size to 1024 by 768.
- Make sure scale = 1
- Set view box x, y, width and height to: 0, 0, 1024, 768.
- Close the document properties and save the file as floorplan.svg

## 1.2 Set the size of the work area
Start drawing your building
